Link-AI
=======

A simple and modular AI. Perfect for experimenting with JavaScript and PHP. The AI, called Link, uses speech recognition and can also respond using speech synthesis.

Important : It is preferable to use https to prevent the constant authorization prompt from the browser. It is also possible to disable the speech recognition feature, in the global.js file (set speechRecognitionSupport to false).

Also, at this point, only a decent computer with the latest version of Chrome will work.
